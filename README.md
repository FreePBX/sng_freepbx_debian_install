Your Open Source Asterisk PBX GUI Solution
```

### What?

[FreePBX](http://www.freepbx.org/ "FreePBX Home Page") is an open source GUI (graphical user interface) that controls and manages [AsteriskÂ©](http://www.asterisk.org/ "Asterisk Home Page") (PBX). FreePBX is licensed under GPL.

This is a FreePBX 17 installation script.

This script is to install FreePBX  on the top of vanilla Debian 12.x OS.

[FreePBX](http://www.freepbx.org/ "FreePBX Home Page") is a completely modular GUI for Asterisk written in PHP and Javascript. Meaning you can easily write any module you can think of and distribute it free of cost to your clients so that they can take advantage of beneficial features in [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/ "Asterisk Home Page")

## Available Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `--dev` | Enables development mode installation. Installs additional development packages that are not included in the standard installation. |
| `--testing` | Uses testing repositories for package installation. Uses `freepbx17-dev` repository instead of `freepbx17-prod`. |
| `--nofreepbx` | Skips FreePBX installation. Useful when you only need to install dependencies or Asterisk. |
| `--noasterisk` | Skips Asterisk installation. Useful when you already have Asterisk installed or only need FreePBX and its dependencies. |
| `--opensourceonly` | Installs only open source modules, removing commercial modules after installation. Will also remove the `sysadmin17` package, the `ioncube-loader-82` package, and the `firewall` module. |
| `--noaac` | Skips installation of the AAC codec (`libfdk-aac2`). |
| `--skipversion` | Skips version checking. By default, the script checks for newer versions and may exit if a newer version is available. This option bypasses that check. |
| `--dahdi` | Installs DAHDI (Digium Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) card support packages for telephony hardware. |
| `--dahdi-only` | Installs only DAHDI components. Equivalent to using `--nofreepbx`, `--noasterisk`, `--noaac`, and `--dahdi` together. |
| `--nochrony` | Skips installation of Chrony (time synchronization service). Automatically enabled when running in a container. |
| `--debianmirror [URL]` | Specifies an alternative Debian mirror URL to use for package downloads. Default is `http://ftp.debian.org/debian`. |
| `--npmmirror [URL]` | Specifies an alternative NPM registry mirror to use for Node.js package downloads. |

### How to execute the script

Steps -

1) ssh to the Debian system as 'root'

2) Download the file using `wget`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/FreePBX/sng_freepbx_debian_install/raw/master/sng_freepbx_debian_install.sh -O /tmp/sng_freepbx_debian_install.sh
```

3) Execute the script:

```bash
bash /tmp/sng_freepbx_debian_install.sh
```

The script will install the necessary dependencies for FreePBX, followed by the FreePBX software itself.

The installation duration may vary depending on your internet bandwidth and system capacity.
