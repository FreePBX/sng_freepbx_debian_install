# There are two recommend ways to override these default values:
#
# You can override the default values in these files on the command line,
#
# or,
#
# Define them in separate files in group_vars/ or host_vars/ directories
# at the same top-level as your playbook. For example, you might copy the
# controls.yml or network.yml file into host_vars/TARGET to start, then
# adjust according to your needs.
